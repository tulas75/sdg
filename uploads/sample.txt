The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This is a sample text for testing our synthetic dataset generator. The purpose of this text is to demonstrate how the application works with different lengths of text. When you upload this file, the system will calculate how many question-answer pairs to generate based on the length of this text. It will then use LiteLLM to generate relevant questions and answers, and finally output them in JSONL format across train, validation, and test files.
